CONFIGURATION

   No special config is needed to allow AgenDAV work with this plugin.

KNOWN LIMITATIONS

This is just a simple iframe integration and most likely won't run with newer
development snapshots of AgenDAV.

The RoundCube language setting is not recognized by AgenDAV, because that is
not a user setting in AgenDAV.



NOTE

Tested with AgenDAV 2.2.0
Tested with RoundCube 1.4-git
